### content

This course provides an introduction to the free and flexible R software. 
Participants will mainly work with hands-on exercises using geoecological data sets for sample analyses. 


### organization

The course ist split into two consecutive parts.
Part 1 is mandatory for students in "Numerik und Simulation".
Part 2 is specifically for PhD-students in NatRisckChange.
Both parts are open to all participants, though seats are prioritized by these groups.

**Part 1** (1 ECTS) takes place in 4 sessions during the first half of the semester:

* tuesdays, **08:15-11:45**, campus Golm, house 25, room **D0.02** (moved to ground floor)
* starting October 23 (2nd week of semester)
* have a 
[PC-pool account](https://www.chem.uni-potsdam.de/groups/pools/Studierende/studierende.html) 
or bring a laptop with working [WiFi](http://www.zeik.uni-potsdam.de/wlan.html) and 
recent [R and Rstudio](https://github.com/brry/course#install). Power sockets are available.
* see the schedule below for session-specific content
* if >20 participants register, there will be a second option on a different day of the week. Please send me an email if you have specific wishes for that time slot.
* it will be necessary to complete homework exercises taking about 1-4 hours per week. 

**Part 2** (2 ECTS) will either continue in the same time slot or be held as a block course in Nov/Dec/Jan, depending on participants' desires.
A solid basic R knowledge (as taught in part 1) is needed for this part!

The course language will be German or English, depending on the participants.


### registration 
Please register per [email](mailto:berry-b@gmx.de), [PULS](https://puls.uni-potsdam.de/qisserver/rds?state=verpublish&publishContainer=lectureContainer&publishid=69945)

### curriculum
**Part 1**

- 2018-10-23: one-session-intro: how and why use R, read files, select data and display it graphically
- 2018-10-30: explore Rstudio, get to know data and object types
- 2018-11-06: use if-else conditionals, program for-loops
- 2018-11-13: write functions, program apply-loops

Details of the contents can be found in the course [slides](https://github.com/brry/course#slides)

**Part 2** will be specified with the participants. Potential topics include

- write and debug complicated functions
- manage NAs, merge data
- export publication-ready graphics
- visualize data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- statistics, distributions & co
- aggregate time series (including changing charstrings to date/time objects)
- read and plot netcdf files (the standard of large spatio-temporal data)
- R as GIS: read shapefile, plot + edit interactively, export as html (sf, mapview, mapedit)
- use Rstudio effectively (keyboard shortcuts, rskey, project management, document outline, ...)
- reproducible report generation with rmarkdown and knitr
- use lapply like a pro
- apply functions to arrays (elegant coding)
- debug functions
- develop an R package
- ...
