This page describes the course "introduction to programming with R" at Potsdam University, fall 2018. 
It is held by Berry Boessenkool, Geoecology graduate and freelance R trainer.
This information takes precendence over the information in PULS due to some last minute changes in schedule.

### content

This course provides an introduction to the free and flexible R software. 
Participants will mainly work with hands-on exercises using geoecological data sets for sample analyses. 


### organization

The course ist split into two consecutive parts.
Part 1 is mandatory for students in "Numerik und Simulation".
Part 2 is mandatory for PhD-students in NatRisckChange.
Both parts are open to all participants, though seats are prioritized by these groups.

**Part 1** takes place in 4 sessions during the first half of the semester:

* tuesdays, **08:15-11:45**, campus Golm, house 25, room **D0.02** (moved to ground floor)
* starting October 23 (2nd week of semester)
* see schedule below for session-specific content
* if >20 participants register, there will be a second option on a different day of the week. Please send me an email if you have specific wishes for that time slot.

**Part 2** will either continue in the same time slot or be held as a block course, depending on participants' desires.

Each participant of the tuesday course must already have a 
[PC-pool account](https://www.chem.uni-potsdam.de/groups/pools/Studierende/studierende.html) 
or bring a laptop with working [WiFi](http://www.zeik.uni-potsdam.de/wlan.html) as well as 
recent [R and Rstudio](https://github.com/brry/course#install). 
It will be necessary to complete homework exercises taking about 1-4 hours per week. 

The course language will be German or English, depending on the participants.


### registration 
Please register per [email](mailto:berry-b@gmx.de) or via the 
moodle course (LINK To BE ADDED SOON).
If you already know the basics from the first sessions, you can join later 
(please let me know via email from which session on).

### curriculum
**Part 1**

- 2018-10-23: one-session-intro: how and why use R, read files, select data and display it graphically
- 2018-10-30: consolidate the contents of the first session, manage NAs, merge data
- 2018-11-06: use if-else conditionals
- 2018-11-13: program loops (for loops, apply functions)

Details of the contents can be found in the course [slides](https://github.com/brry/course#slides)

**Part 2** will be specified with the participants. Potential topics include

- write and debug functions
- export publication-ready graphics
- visualize data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- statistics
- aggregate time series (including changing charstrings to date/time objects)
- read and plot netcdf files (the standard of large spatio-temporal data)
- R as GIS: read shapefile, plot + edit interactively, export as html (sf, mapview, mapedit)
- work reproducibly - project management with Rstudio
- use Rstudio effectively (keyboard shortcuts, rskey, document outline, ...)
- use lapply like a pro
- apply functions to arrays (elegant coding)
- debug functions
- develop an R package
- ...
